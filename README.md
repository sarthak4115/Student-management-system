STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.........................................


This project is a simple yet effective Student Management System built in C++. It offers core functionality for managing student records using file handling. Designed with beginner-friendly C++ code, it enables adding, viewing, and searching for student data, making it ideal for understanding fundamental file operations and object-oriented programming.

# Features
1. Add Student Record - Add a new studentâ€™s details including roll number, name, father's name, and address.
2. View All Student Records - Display all student records stored in the file.
3. Search Student Record - Search for a student record by roll number.
4. Exit - Exit the application.

   
#Benefits of This Code

1. Simplicity and Readability: The code is well-organized and easy to read, which makes it suitable for beginners in C++ programming.
2. Efficient File Handling: The use of file operations (fstream) makes the system efficient at managing records without requiring a database.
3. Object-Oriented Design: This project demonstrates core principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation by grouping related data and functions within the temp class.
4. Modular Structure: Each function serves a distinct purpose, making the code modular, easier to debug, and expandable for future improvements.
5. Basic Error Handling: The code includes handling for common user input errors, which enhances user experience.

   # Code Structure
The project consists of a single class, temp, which includes methods for:

1. Adding a student record to a file (addStu)
2. Viewing all student records (viewStu)
3. Searching for a student record by roll number (searchStu)
   
# Future Improvements
1. Add delete and update functionality for student records.
2. Implement advanced error handling and data validation.
3. Enhance the user interface for better interaction.

   
This Student Management System provides a practical way to practice C++ file handling and OOP basics, making it a great project for learners. Enjoy coding and expanding upon this foundation!!!
